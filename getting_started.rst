Getting started
===============

Use a workspace:

#. Clone all the projects in the Github organization `sword-and-sorcery`_
#. Use files inside project `conanquest-fantastic-adventures`_ to build all
   the files for the project. There is a hardcoded path inside the layout
   file, change it to the basepath of your workspace. Modify the paths to the
   editable projects if needed (I'm cloning all the projects inside the same
   directory).
